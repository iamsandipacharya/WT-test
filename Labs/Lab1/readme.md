# Theory
An unordered list starts with the ul-tag. Each list item starts with the li-tag.The list items will be marked with bullets by default
An unordered list starts with the ol-tag. Each list item starts with the li-tag.The list items will be marked with numbers by default
A nested list is a list inside another list. We can create a nested unordered list, or a nested ordered list, or even an ordered list nested inside an unordered one
Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content.E.g.-artcle,header,footer,summary,aside,table,etc.

HTML text formatting tags helps for better look and feel. HTML provides us ability to format text without using CSS. There are many formatting tags in HTML. These tags are used to make text bold, italicized,underlined,etc..
The HTML video-tag is used to show a video on a web page.
The HTML audio-tag is used to show a audio on a web page.
The HTML img-tag is used to show a video on a web page.
The HTML iframe-tag is used to run another webpage inside our web page.
